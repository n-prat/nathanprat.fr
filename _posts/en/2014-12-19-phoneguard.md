This post is about an Android app I developed for myself as an exercice.

You can find it [here](https://github.com/nathanprat/phoneguard)

I started with the goal to create an Android Device Manager/Plan B clone.

1. sms controlled with feedback and password auth
2. access to location
3. Data activation if needed
