## What does it do?

Recursively converts every Python and IPython Notebook in a directory to Python 3.  
The conversion is done with *2to3*.  
The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/nathanprat/2to3-ipynb)

## How to use?

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BACKUP  
The files will be overridden

convert_all *directory*

Will convert every .py and .ipynb files in *directory* to Python 3  
*directory* can also be a single file  

It should use all your CPU cores.

## NOTES

If you get *UnicodeDecodeError* when loading with pickle :  
Replace `pickle.load` with `pickle.load(f,encoding='latin1')`  
This is because Python 3 is using unicode.  
Or use [this](https://github.com/nathanprat/pickle-convert) which will update the pickle files to the newest protocol.
